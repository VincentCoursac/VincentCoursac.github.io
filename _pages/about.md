Hello!

I'm Vincent, a 27-year-old **Software Engineer and Gameplay Programmer** from France. I graduated from **Efrei Paris**, where I specialized in software engineering. Over the years, I've gained a wealth of experience in various IT fields, including **web development** and **mobile applications** for both Android and iOS. After completing my studies, I decided to focus on **gameplay programming**.

I've had the privilege of working with some of the top French studios on exciting and ambitious projects (you can find more details below). Alongside my professional journey, I've nurtured my entrepreneurial spirit by founding three start-ups. For a deeper dive into my background, feel free to check out my [CV](https://vincentcoursac.github.io/assets/CV_COURSAC_Vincent.pdf).

My expertise lies primarily in game development with **Unreal Engine**, although I'm highly versatile and have experience with several proprietary engines.

Since stepping away from my last start-up, I've been dedicating my time to creating my own game experiences. However, I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.

Feel free to reach out to me!
