My first job was as a **junior gameplay programmer** at **Kylotonn**, where I had the opportunity to work on the sequel to Test Drive License: Solar Crown. Originally, the project was meant to be a straightforward remake of Test Drive Unlimited 2, but it evolved into a full-fledged sequel set on the island of Hong Kong. This shift meant starting from the previous episode's source code, which was developed by another studio, and integrating Kylotonn's cutting-edge technology (KT Engine) for graphics and physics. The KT Engine is Kylotonn's proprietary game engine, specializing in motorsports simulations and featuring PBR rendering.

When I joined the team, the project was in its infancy. Much of the old game's source code was still present and partially playable. Our goal was straightforward yet challenging: clean up the existing code and implement the new features that would transform the 2011 game (TDU 2) into a brand-new, modern game!

Although I initially joined as a gameplay programmer, my knowledge of networks, which I'd recently acquired at Ubisoft during my internship on Ghost Recon, was called upon at certain times to give the engine team a hand on certain network features.

## Responsibilities

### Cleaning and improving
- Cleaning deprecated features, improving others
- Replacing some legacy UIs to debug IMGUI ones

### Gameplay programming
- Racing related features
- Cars related features
- Making the legacy AI races opponents replicated
- World map first iteration
- UI integration

### Network programming
- Helping improving and maintaining the network & replication system
- Developing some network features such as a Backblaze integration (S3 like cloud storage) to store some player data (for example screenshots or race ghosts)

And of course debug and optimization !
